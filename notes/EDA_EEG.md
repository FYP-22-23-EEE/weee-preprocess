EDA stands for Electrodermal Activity, and it is a measure of the changes in the electrical conductance of the skin. It is often used as a measure of arousal or emotional state, as the sweat glands in the skin are controlled by the sympathetic nervous system, which is active during times of stress or arousal.

EEG stands for Electroencephalogram, and it is a measure of the electrical activity of the brain. It is typically recorded using electrodes placed on the scalp, and it reflects the summed activity of millions of neurons in the brain. EEG is often used in the diagnosis and treatment of neurological disorders, as well as in research on brain function.
